So I was on erasmus for 6 months in Portugal Coimbra and right now in my home uni we doing, android apps.
I haven't written in java for months so I wanted to create a small amatuer project which will remind me a bit 
with the syntaxis of Java. 





PROJECT NAME TO-DO lisT/REMINDER 
My thought was to create a To-Do daily list like a reminder for important tasks for every month. 
It's not something special but I need to start getting familiar with github so thats my first "project"

Just git clone and you will see my main class. Open it and run !!

Im not using anything special for dependencies/libraries/imports
